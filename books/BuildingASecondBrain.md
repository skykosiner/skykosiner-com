# Summary & Notes

## Introduction - The Promise of a Second
* The promise of a [[second brain]] is a system for all your thoughts to go, a place so that you never forget anything again
* A place for you to store your current learnings so that later on days, weeks or even years later when you're making something or talking about something realeted to the topic you can easily find all your faults on it

### What the second brain system will teach you
* Find anything you've learned or thought in the past
* Organize your knowledge and use it in your projects and to help your goals
* Save your thoughts, so you don't have to think kof them again (as [[David Allen]] says your brain is coming up with ideas not
storing them)
* Connect your ideas and thoughts together and notice patterns in areas of your life
* Adopt a reliable system that helps you share your work more confidently and with more ease
* Turn your work off knowing you have a trusted system keeping track of everything
* Spend less time looking for things, and more time doing things, and doing the most creative work you are capable of

* If we use technology correctly you can leverage it to help with your goals, projects, and relationships in life
* Having a good personal knowledge management system is one of the best things you can do in the modern world
	* You can have every single thought, plan, memory, guide and much more all in your pocket
* We all consume so much information on a daily basis and without a system to manage it we only take away a small amount of the information and apply it to our lives, but building a system you won't forget this info.
* Without some sort of system to organize everything you will lose track of important items, and not take away more then a few lessons from each book, article, podcast, and audiobook you consume

## Chapter 1 - Where it All Started
* The beginning bit of this chapter goes over [[Tiago Fortes]] story of his medical condition, and how he was forgetting things so he decided to start writing down every small bit of info to remember it
