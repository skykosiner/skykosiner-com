#+title: Why I Use Linux

* Intro
Recently I had my main work machine (2020 Razer Blade base model running arch
Linux) break down on me, and luckily I'm forutanite enough to have two other
macs to fall back to. But the thing is that well my god, do I miss Linux and
forget how many things I take for granted every day which I'm surprised you
can't do on Mac or espaicly windows well.
* Tiling window manger
Ono of the greatest things I love about linux is the idea of tiling window
mangers. While yes they do tile windows and make your more productive and save
time without having to move things around with floating windows. They allow you
to do so much more.
** Tiling
Before I go over all the other great things about tiling window mangers I want
to talk about the main feautre which is ofcourse tliing.

The whole idea of tiling is that unlike a nomal desktop envoriment such as gnoe,
kde, or something like mac or windows, your windows are atuomaticlly are
organized into layout for you.
