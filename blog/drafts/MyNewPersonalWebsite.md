# My New Personal Website

One of the first project I worked on when I started to learn web development
was my own personal website. At first, I made everything with just HTML, CSS,
and JS. But then I found about react.js and decided to make everything in
react, even though nothing on my website needed react. It just made my
website more bloated and complicated.
