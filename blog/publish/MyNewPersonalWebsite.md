# My new personal website

## Why I remade my website
When I first got into coding I found my self remaking my personal website all
the time, as I didn't know what other kind of project to work on. But over the
past year and a bit I've been able to think of good projects to work on. So no I
did not make this website as I ran out of idea. I made this as I felt like using
next.js was too much for how simple my website was.

## Tech Stack
My goal for creating this website was to have a simple techstack that didn't add
a bunch of JavaScript bloat. I'm not against using JavaScript when I need it,
but for example this website only has JavaScript to fetch the posts from the go
api, other then that almost 0 JavaScript is used.

For example the logic for searching for blog posts and showing the restults is
all done by making a GET request in a form to the go backend, and the go backend
renders out a template `search.html`.

### Golang
Golang has quickly become my favorite programming language, and I've found that
I can make almost anything I need to or want to with golang.
