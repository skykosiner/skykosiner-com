Hey guys, I know I missed last months issue and I'm late on this one. But I've just been so busy recently that time has passed me by to write this.

I've been having to study to retake my maths GCSE so that's fun, and along with that I've been working on videos coming to the [channel](https://youtube.com/@skykosiner) soon. Oh and I also worked on my [Z Fold 5 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZmwHjku4to) which was one of my most time consuming videos I've made to date. I spent over 180 hours scripting, filming, and editing. I wanted to make the highest quality video I could for a phone that I'm really interested in and I felt like the video did the phone justice. Since then I've been trying to focus on cleaning up my production pipeline for YouTube and my Instagram in order to make production for creating things faster.

My system for creating content revolves around [todoist](https://todoist.com), Google Docs, and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Todoist is what I use to help keep track of all the tasks I need to do and where the piece of content is in the pipeline. I then use Obsidain to help take notes, write captions, write shot lists, brain storm ideas for coming up with content, and to help manage my all my personal knowledge management. Obsidian is my favorite note taking app that I recommend to anyone! It's built from the ground up with an extensive amount of features yet very easy to use and you don't need to use all the features if you don't want to. Then last but not least is google docs. While it's not the most flashy tool when it comes to writing scripts for videos google docs is the most reliable tool I've found that works well for me.

This new system over the past two and a bit months has really helped me to make sure I stay on top everything I do. I do have a compliant though, todoist is cool and all. But I really do wish that [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) was available on Android and Linux as the way Things works and feels compared to todoist is about 500 times better.

I'll leave you all here for this month. A new video is coming soon. Have a good month everyone.
