Over the month of August I've had quite a good time to be honest. In this months issue I'm going to go over what I've been up to this month, and what my plans are for next month.

# Tech
First off towards the start of the month I published my first YouTube video back after a year, [Folding phones one year later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BhGFdTyPKY). And it did a lot better then I was expecting, massing over 744 views. At the time of writing this. I really enjoyed making videos again and it was so much fun to work on something creative.

Since I made that video I've received my z fold 5, so I'm in the middle of working on the review for that phone. I'm almost done the video, I'm just gathering a few more b-roll shots then need to edit and hopefully some point next week it should be live!

Along with that I also bought a Samsung watch as it makes more sense then having an apple watch as I use Samsung as my daily carry, although I still do carry an iPhone with me. I'm planning on making a video about the Samsung watch soon too. I'm super excited as it seems really neat compared to my apple watch of yore.

# Media
## Tv Show
Into the non tech world this month I've really been enjoying the new futurerama reboot. So far other then the crypto episode I feel it's held up very well to the shows pre 2013 quality. If you're looking for a new show to watch I 100% recommend it!
## Music
I'm also really looking forward to the 1989 (Taylor's Version) announced earlier this month. 1989 is one of my favourite albums so I'm really hoping the vault tracks and the rerecorded tracks sound good too!

# Wrap up
I don't really have a lot to talk about this month, but I've got some big things I'm excited for coming soon! I hope you all have a great September!
