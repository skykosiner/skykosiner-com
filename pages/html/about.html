                    <h2 class="subTitle">Progarming Joureny</h2>
                    <p>I started to code at the age of 11 with python. Then at
                        12 went into the world of frontend web development, but
                        after a while I got bored so I started to learn backend.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>After awhile I found JavaScript annoying and a pain, so I
                    played around with typescript and made a few projects with
                    Typescript.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p>But once again I found Typescript still shared
                    issues with JavaScript so I looked into rust, but it was too
                    hard for me. So I decided to learn golang, and right now
                    golang is my favorite programming languages, no matter if
                    it's for cli tools, tui tools, api's or more.</p>

                    <br />
                    <h2 class="subTitle">Linux Joureny</h2>
                    <p>When I first started to really get into coding I got a
                    mac as I heard about this idea of a UNIX system being easier
                    to code on.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>But I didn't really understand it. Overtime I started to
                    want to do things more efficent from the terminal, and I
                    slowly started to learn the basics UNIX shell oprations.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>After a while I decided to switch to vim and went linux full
                    time on my main machine. These days I do most things in

                    _blank">Arch BTW</a>). Overall Learning Linux was a very
                    good decision I'm glad I made.</p>
