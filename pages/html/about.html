                    <p>Hello world, my name is Sky, I’m a tarns girl who codes and creates
                    content.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Ever since I was the age of 6 I’ve been interested in programing and
                    computers, and at the age of 11 I started to teach my self to code
                    seriously. I started with HTML, CSS, and JS and slowly started to move
                    into exploring other things such as backend, typescript, golang, rust,
                    linux, and more.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Over the past few years I’ve been documenting my coding journey on
                    Instagram which over 12.1k people are interested in. Furthermore, I also
                    have a YouTube channel where I like to talk about coding, tech, and
                    productivity.</p>

                    <h2 class="subTitle">What I’m doing now</h2>
                    <p>These days I’m working on furthering my coding knowledge, and sharing
                    what I learn online.</p>
                    <p>I’m also planning on getting an apprenticeship for work next year,
                    and to take it Futher into my coding/programming journey.</p>
