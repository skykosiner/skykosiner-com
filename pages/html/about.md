# About Me
Hello world, my name is Sky, I’m a trans girl who codes and creates
content.

Ever since I was the age of 6 I’ve been interested in programing and
computers, and at the age of 11 I started to teach my self to code
seriously. I started with HTML, CSS, and JS and slowly started to move
into exploring other things such as backend, typescript, golang, rust,
linux, and more.

Over the past few years I’ve been documenting my coding journey on
Instagram which over 12.1k people are interested in. Furthermore, I also
have a YouTube channel where I like to talk about coding, tech, and
productivity.

## What I’m doing now
These days I’m working on furthering my coding knowledge, and sharing
what I learn online. I’m also planning on getting an apprenticeship for work next year,
and to take it Futher into my coding/programing journey.
