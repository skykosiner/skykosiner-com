## 📝 What I'm working on right now
* 🎬 [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@SkyKosiner)
	Over the past few years I've been making videos for on and off. I've been trying to commit now to one video a month.

	I make video's about tech, productivity, books, coding, and more.

* 📸 [Instagram](https://twitter.com/KosinerSky)
	Over the last 4 years I've been trying to post on instagram constantly to share valuable content which at first started out with coding, and now ranges from coding to productivity and more!

	These days I post on Instagram around 3 times a week, and share all the valuable insights I can find.!

* 📝 [Blogging](/html/blog-page.html)
	Ever since I started to teach my self how to code and how to make websites I’ve always had this idea of making a blog. It took me over 4 years but I’ve finally committed to a website design I like and a blogging method that I like with just static markdown files.

	Along with my blog I also have an [Email newsletter](https://skykosiner.substack.com/?r=8b9un&utm_campaign=pub-share-checklist) that I write once a month sharing everything I've worked on in that month and some of my favourite things from that past month.
