# Tools I'm using
## Software
### [Qtile](https://qtile.org)
I find normal floating window mangers very inefficient, so I use a tiling
window manager. The one which I like the most is qtile. I used to use i3, but I
got tired of its design, and it's unique tiling methods compared to other
winnow mangers.

### [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
I've used almost all big the terminals and after playing around with all of
them I decided that kitty is my favorite terminal. It does everything I need it
to do, it's fast, and the config I need to get it working well for me is very
minimal.

### [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
For almost 3 years now I've used neovim as my main text editor of choice. It's
the best text editor I've ever used, I can change everything I want with code
and, it's super lightweight and doesn't take up all my ram.

### [Brave browser](https://brave.com/)
This one isn't too hard to explain, I wanted a good browser that was speedy and
blocked adds and blocked tracking. Brave is the best answer for that on Linux.

### [Lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)
I like to do everything I can from a terminal, so I use the lf file browser to
manage all my basic file needs without using a GUI. I'm able to use a custom
set of key binds I've setup (vim keybinds) and use bash script to add more
functions.

### [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/)
Instead of using bash I like to use zsh, as it's a more modern shell. But I'll
still write all my scripts in bash.

### [Neomutt](https://neomutt.org/)
Once again I like to do everything I can from the terminal, so I use neomutt to
do all my email management. Everything is superfast and not too hard to setup
using the [mutt wizard](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard) script
from Luke Smith. I'm also running my own custom email server.
